    <h2 class="heading subtitle">Description</h2>
    <p>This strawberry pie is my favourite pie, and it's very easy to make.</br>I got the recipe many years ago in North Jersey from the Sussex County Strawberry Farm.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 quart fresh strawberries, hulled</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Arrange 1/2 of strawberries in baked pastry shell. Place remaining strawberries in a medium saucepan</li>
        <li>Add sugar to the strawberries in the saucepan; place over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.</li>
